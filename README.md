# ngxTourWizard 1.0.20

A cool Angular5+ module for intro tours!

# Before starting

##IMPORTANT for IE

This library use CustomEvents. If you want compatibility with IE,
you should add a polyfill to your app polyfills.ts.

See polyfill on [gist](https://gist.github.com/tonysamperi/0e73f8489000e8261600a92af92748c1)

##Styling

As you may know directives don't have a "Styles" property.
So it's impossible to let them style your markup,
**unless** you include an external CSS.

For this purpose the style of directives is compiled in

* /styles/ngx-tour-wizard.css
* /styles/ngx-tour-wizard.scss

Be sure of including at least one of these in your styles.css / styles.scss
to get the basic style

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install ngx-tour-wizard@latest
```

and then from your Angular `AppModule`:

```typescript
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

// Import what you need from ngx-mat-lib
import { TourWizardModule } from 'ngx-tour-wizard';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,

    // Specify the import
    TourWizardModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

You can optionally use the `forRoot()` method and pass tourWizardDefaults as follows

```js
// ...
providers: [
    TourWizardModule.forRoot({
        backdropTarget: ".my-selector",
        backdropEnabled: true,
        keyboardEnabled: false
    })
]
// ...
```

Once your library is imported, you can use its components, directives and pipes in your Angular application:

```html
<!-- You can now use your library component in app.component.html -->
<h1>
  {{title}}
</h1>
<span class="tour-wizard-button tour-wizard-text-gloria"
          (click)="startTour()">
    Start tour
</span>
<any class="tour-wizard-text-gloria" tourWizardAnchor="FOO_1">MY ANCHOR 1 </any>
<any class="tour-wizard-text-gloria" tourWizardAnchor="FOO_2">MY ANCHOR 2 </any>
<any class="tour-wizard-text-gloria" tourWizardAnchor="FOO_3">MY ANCHOR 3</any>
```

```js
// SOME CONTENT
constructor(private _tourWizardService: TourWizardService) {
}
    
ngOnInit(): void {
    this._tourWizardService.initialize([
        {
            anchorId: "FOO_1",
            content: "Some text for FOO 1",
            title: "First"
        },
        {
            anchorId: "FOO_2",
            content: "Some other stuff for FOO 2",
            title: "Second"
        },
        {
            anchorId: "FOO_3",
            content: "Let's finish this up!!!",
            title: "Third"
        },
    ] as TourWizardStep[]);
}

 startTour(): void {
    this._tourWizardService.start();
}
// SOME OTHER CONTENT
```
