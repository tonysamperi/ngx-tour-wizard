# Before starting

##IMPORTANT for IE

This library use CustomEvents. If you want compatibility with IE,
you should add a polyfill to your app polyfills.ts.

See polyfill on [gist](https://gist.github.com/tonysamperi/0e73f8489000e8261600a92af92748c1)

##Styling

As you may know directives don't have a "Styles" property.
So it's impossible to let them style your markup,
**unless** you include an external CSS.

For this purpose you can import prebuild themes for NgxTourWizard...

...in SASS style, where you can edit variables (it's very straight forward so read the source)

`@import "node_modules/ngx-tour-wizard/scss/tour-wizard.scss";`

...or in CSS style (and you can always override everything you want)

 `@import "node_modules/ngx-tour-wizard/css/tour-wizard.css";`

Be sure of including at least one of these in your styles.css / styles.scss
to get the basic style

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install ngx-tour-wizard@latest
```

and then from your Angular `AppModule`:

```typescript
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

// Import what you need from ngx-mat-lib
import { TourWizardModule } from 'ngx-tour-wizard';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,

    // Specify the import
    TourWizardModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

You can optionally use the `forRoot()` method and pass tourWizardDefaults as follows

```js
// ...
providers: [
    TourWizardModule.forRoot({
        backdropTarget: ".my-selector",
        backdropEnabled: true,
        keyboardEnabled: false
    })
]
// ...
```

Once your library is imported, you can use its components, directives and pipes in your Angular application:

```html
<!-- You can now use your library component in app.component.html -->
<h1>
  {{title}}
</h1>
<span (click)="startTour()">
    Start tour
</span>
<any tourWizardAnchor="FOO_1">MY ANCHOR 1 </any>
<any tourWizardAnchor="FOO_2">MY ANCHOR 2 </any>
<any tourWizardAnchor="FOO_3">MY ANCHOR 3</any>
```

```typescript
import { TourWizardService, TourWizardStep } from 'ngx-tour-wizard';

export class MyComponent {

    constructor(private _tourWizardService: TourWizardService) {
    }

    ngOnInit(): void {
        this._tourWizardService.initialize([
            {
                anchorId: "FOO_1",
                content: "Some text for FOO 1",
                title: "First"
            },
            {
                anchorId: "FOO_2",
                content: "Some other stuff for FOO 2",
                title: "Second"
            },
            {
                anchorId: "FOO_3",
                content: "Let's finish this up!!!",
                title: "Third"
            },
        ] as TourWizardStep[]);
    }

    startTour(): void {
        this._tourWizardService.start();
    }
}

```
